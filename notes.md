# Microservices

1. **What is a Microservice**
   A project structure for big projects. Compare to monolithic applications. Can do it for small projects but it becomes complicated quickly. The orchestration is complicated. The solution should stand in propotion to the problem.

Docker containers are not the same as microservices.

2. When to use microservices
   **Rule of Thumb**
   Docker containers = good for almost all project sizes. These should almost always be used.
   Microservices = good for big companies with a lot of code and people
   Sweetspot = Monolith app and databases in containers
